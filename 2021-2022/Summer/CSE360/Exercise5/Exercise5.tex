    \section*{Problem 1}

    A group of middle school students want to create a program to help a robot navigate
    through a maze. There are sensors on the front, left, and right side of the robot. These
    sensors send two possible signals, “Y” - there is a wall in this direction and “N” - there is
    no wall in this direction. The sensors send these signals every three seconds and
    depending on the combination of signals, the robot will perform a different action.
    
    The students decided to make the program do the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
        If there is no wall to the front, left, and right of the robot
        -- Move forward
        \item
        If there is no wall in front and left of the robot and there is a wall to the right of the
        robot
        -- Move forward
        \item
        If there is no wall in front and right of the robot and there is a wall to the left of the
        robot
        -- Move forward
        \item
        If there is no wall in front of the robot and there is a wall to the left and right of the
        robot
        -- Move forward
        \item
        If there is a wall in front of the robot and there is no wall to the left and right of the
        robot
        -- Turn left and move forward
        \item
        If there is a wall in front and to the right of the robot and there is no wall to the left
        of the robot
        -- Turn left and move forward
        \item
        If there is a wall in front and to the left of the robot and there is no wall to the right
        of the robot
        -- Turn right and move forward
        \item
        If there is wall in front, to the left, and to the right of the robot
        -- Turn around 180° and move forward
    \end{itemize}

    The students need help making the decision table. Fill in the missing “???” conditions to
    make the decision table match the list of decisions described above.

    \section*{Problem 2}

    There are eight rules from problem 1. Some of the rules are redundant (see the second
    video at the 7:18 minute mark) since they result in the same action. Use the table below
    to reduce the decision table from problem 1. Use a “ - “ to represent the conditions that
    do not matter in the rule.

            Conditions & $R_1$ & $R_2$ & $R_3$ & $R_4$ \\
            \hline
            There is a wall in front of the robot & N & Y & Y & Y \\
            There is a wall to the left of the robot & - & N & Y & Y \\
            There is a wall to the right of the robot & - & - & N & Y \\

    \section*{Problem 3}

    A client is starting up a bike rental service and has hired you to create the system to
    charge customers. After talking with the client, you have determined the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
        If a customer rents the bike for less than 2 hours, they should be charged \$7.
        \item
        If a customer rents the bike for more than 2 hours, they should be charged \$25.
        \item
        If a customer rents a bike helmet, they should be charged \$5.
        \item
        If a customer rents a bike lock, they should be charged \$5.
        \item
        If a damaged bike is returned, the customer should be charged \$20.
    \end{itemize}
    Items (a) and (b) are considered the base price of the rental. All the other items add an
    extra fee onto the base price.

    Create a decision table to model the conditions and actions described above. Note: the
    table below is a placeholder, you can add/remove rows and columns as needed.
